Feature construction for Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)

- Jaedeug Choi (jdchoi@ai.kaist.ac.kr)

This package contains the algorithms of feature construction for IRL, including the algorithm in [ChoiKim.13]. This package is mainly based on Levine's IRL-Toolkit [Levine.11]. Please read README_Levine.txt.

# Requirement
This package was built with Matlab2012b.

# Package overview
- BirlGA: Finding a maximum-a-posterior (MAP) estimate in Bayesian framework for IRL [ChoiKim.11].
- NPBFIRL: Constructing useful composite features for learning the reward function by using a Bayesian nonparametric approach [ChoiKim.13].

# Usage
Use the scripts whose filename starts with "test".
